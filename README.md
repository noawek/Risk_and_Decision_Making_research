# Research in The Lab for Social Decision Making & Risk ðŸ§ ðŸ“Š
Welcome to my research repository for The Lab for Social Decision Making & Risk under the guidance of Prof. Yoella Bereby-Meyer. This project explores the topic of "Active vs. Passive Risk Perception: How do I see myself vs. others?" using data collected from participants via a Qualtrics survey I designed, where each participant was presented with three different scenarios and asked about their perception of risk. In this exploratory study, I aimed to examine how people perceive their own risk-seeking tendencies compared to those of others, in both active and passive risk-taking contexts, and the analysis that was conducted in R utilizes advanced statistical methods.
